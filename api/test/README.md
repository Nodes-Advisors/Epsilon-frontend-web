# Tpyes of Tests:

## 1. Unit Tests
Unit tests focus on testing individual functions or components in isolation. For your backend, this would typically involve testing specific middleware or utility functions.

## 2. Integration Tests
Integration tests check how different parts of your application work together, such as testing routes with a database.

## 3. End-to-End Tests
End-to-end tests simulate user interactions from start to finish. These are typically more complex and may involve setting up a testing environment that includes your actual database.



# For kpiexcel_backend.js:
- Much of the functionality is tied to the Express routes and MongoDB interactions, which are more suited for integration testing
- If we have a utility function that processes the data received from MongoDB before sending it back in the response, we can use unit test
